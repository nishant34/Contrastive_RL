* This is the implementation of algorithm similar to what is described in the paper Contrastive Unsupervised Representaion for Reinforcement Learning(ICML 2020) [CURL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04136).
* SAC is used along with contratsive losses to speed up the process.
* Tensorboard logs will be uploaded soon.

# Requirements
* Python 3.6 or greater will be fine.
* Pytorch 1.14 or greater will be fine.
